			My first car was an '86 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera. It was once
			my Grandfather's and I purchased it from my Grandmother.
			In the glove box there was a small note pad that he used
			to keep
			track of oil changes and fill-ups. I don't know why but
			I continued doing it. When that car died I kept going
			with the next car.
